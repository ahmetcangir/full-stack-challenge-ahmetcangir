# Setup for a Vagrant-Based Environment

A Vagrant-based environment is the preferred way to replicate the coding challenge environment on your system. It is relatively easy to install, especially when compared with installing all the different software components one-by-one, directly on your System.


## Installation Steps 

### Step 1 - Install Vagrant 

Vagrant can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux from the [Vagrant website](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Visit the website, then click on the Downloads link and chose the right version of the software for your PCâ€™s operating system.

### Step 2 - Install the rest
 * Clone the repository from GitHub into a working copy on your system
